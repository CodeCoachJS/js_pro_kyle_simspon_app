# Work with Kyle Simpson

---

This app has been forked from Kyle Simpson's `YouPeriod` app you can check out [here](https://github.com/getify/youperiod.app).

At a high level, this app allows a user to store information directly on their device in a secure way, without the need for an external database.

Great idea.

This app is NOT ready for public usage and is under active development, so there is some room to extend or improve functionality.

### Getting Started

```js
npm i
npm start
```

### TODO

---

1. How does this app actually store data? What type of encryption methods are used?
2. Extend the functionality of this app to add some validation for when a user creates an acount. Currently, there is no feedback when a user password is too short.
3. Add functionality to set the number of hours or minutes that some user data should be stored before being deleted.

**BONUS:** add a single test to any piece of functionality (login or entering data)
